Formatting Your Text
====================
Surround a word or phrase in asterisks to *make italics*.

Two asterisks makes **bold**.

Three makes ***bold italics***.

---

To surround a phrase in actual asterisks, use backslashes.

\*looks around\*

---

Small text uses the &lt;small&gt; tag.

<small>Just making a minor point.</small>

---

Make a bulleted list with asterisks (or hyphens, or plus signs).

* First thing
* Second thing
* Third thing

---

Make a numbered list with numbers followed by periods, then spaces. 

1. First thing
2. Second thing
3. Third thing
3. Last-minute addition. (Your numbers don't have to be in order.)
4. Fourth thing

---

Make a block quote by beginning a paragraph with >

*The Lottery*, by Shirley Jackson, begins:

> The morning of June 27th was clear and sunny, with the fresh warmth of a full-summer day; the flowers were blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green.

Use brackets to make links. The first pair of brackets is the text to turn into a link; the second pair of brackets refers to a footnote with the address to link to.

[Cat-Scan.com][1] is one of the strangest sites I've seen in some time.

You can also name your links, which is helpful if you have a lot of them.

[How to Cook Vegetables][cook]. [How to Flavor with Spices][spices]. [How to Flavor with Fresh Herbs][herbs]. [How to Maximize Flavor using the Flavor Star][flavor star]. [An international guide to Aromatics][aromatics].

And you can leave the second bracket in a link empty, to use the text as the name of the link.
